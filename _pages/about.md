I currently lead an ML and robotics research team at Apple.

In 2021, I received a PhD in Aeronautics &amp; Astronautics from Stanford University where I studied under the guidance of Professor Marco Pavone. My research leveraged machine learning, optimization and control theory to address planning and control problems in robotics.

In 2015, I received a Bachelor of Science and a Master of Engineering in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. At MIT, I conducted research under the supervision of Professor Russ Tedrake.

Over my time as a researcher, I had the privilege of becoming a [Siebel Scholar](https://www.siebelscholars.com/), and receive the Stanford Robotics Center Fellowship supported by FANUC. I cofounded the [Stanford Robotics Seminar](https://stanfordasl.github.io/robotics_seminar), and helped design and teach the first two instances of [Principles of Robotic Autonomy](https://news.stanford.edu/2018/04/10/autonomous-robotics-class-integrates-theory-practice/).
